# Population-Calculater
# Background

This programming project will use the input and print functions along with some simple mathematics for conversion. The important part of the project is to learn the skills needed to access the class web site to download a project description, create a new program in Python and finally to hand it in.

We are going to estimate the population of the United States based on some information found at a website provided by the US census:
http://www.census.gov/population/www/popclockus.html That website specifies the following information:

--A number that represents the current population. We will fix that number for the this project at the value: 307357870
--3 rates:
    --every 7 seconds, a birth
    --every 13 seconds, a death
    --every 35 seconds, a new immigrant

Predicting into the future using only these numbers is not very accurate since the rates are likely to change, but it does give you a general idea for short predictions (only a few years into the future). Longer predictions (100â€™s of years) are likely to be more inaccurate.
